def polyfromroots(roots):

    Generate a monic polynomial with given roots.

    Return the coefficients of the polynomial

    .. math:: p(x) = (x - r_0) * (x - r_1) * ... * (x - r_n),

    where the ``r_n`` are the roots specified in `roots`.  If a zero has
    multiplicity n, then it must appear in `roots` n times. For instance,
    if 2 is a root of multiplicity three and 3 is a root of multiplicity 2,
    then `roots` looks something like [2, 2, 2, 3, 3]. The roots can appear
    in any order.

    If the returned coefficients are `c`, then

    .. math:: p(x) = c_0 + c_1 * x + ... +  x^n

    The coefficient of the last term is 1 for monic polynomials in this
    form.

    Parameters
    ----------
    roots : array_like
        Sequence containing the roots.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        1-D array of the polynomial's coefficients If all the roots are
        real, then `out` is also real, otherwise it is complex.  (see

    The coefficients are determined by multiplying together linear factors

    Integrate a polynomial.

    Returns the polynomial coefficients `c` integrated `m` times from

    **multiplied** by `scl` and an integration constant, `k`, is added.
    The scaling factor is for use in a linear change of variable.  ("Buyer
    beware": note that, depending on what one is doing, one may want `scl`
    to be the reciprocal of what one might expect; for more information,
    see the Notes section below.) The argument `c` is an array of

    m : int, optional
        Order of integration, must be positive. (Default: 1)
    k : {[], list, scalar}, optional
        Integration constant(s).  The value of the first integral at zero
        is the first value in the list, the value of the second integral
        at zero is the second value, etc.  If ``k == []`` (the default),
        all constants are set to zero.  If ``m == 1``, a single scalar can
        be given instead of a list.
    lbnd : scalar, optional
        The lower bound of the integral. (Default: 0)
    scl : scalar, optional
        Following each integration the result is *multiplied* by `scl`
        before the integration constant is added. (Default: 1)
    axis : int, optional
        Axis over which the integral is taken. (Default: 0).

    S : ndarray
        Coefficient array of the integral.

    ValueError

        ``np.ndim(scl) != 0``.

    See Also
    --------
    polyder

    Notes
    -----
    Note that the result of each integration is *multiplied* by `scl`.  Why
    is this important to note?  Say one is making a linear change of
    variable :math:`u = ax + b` in an integral relative to `x`. Then
    :math:`dx = du/a`, so one will need to set `scl` equal to
    :math:`1/a` - perhaps not what one would have first thought.

    Evaluate a polynomial at points x.

    If `c` is of length `n + 1`, this function returns the value

    .. math:: p(x) = c_0 + c_1 * x + ... + c_n * x^n

    The parameter `x` is converted to an array only if it is a tuple or a
    list, otherwise it is treated as a scalar. In either case, either `x`
    or its elements must support multiplication and addition both with
    themselves and with the elements of `c`.

    If `c` is a 1-D array, then `p(x)` will have the same shape as `x`.  If
    `c` is multidimensional, then the shape of the result depends on the
    value of `tensor`. If `tensor` is true the shape will be c.shape[1:] +
    x.shape. If `tensor` is false the shape will be c.shape[1:]. Note that
    scalars have shape (,).

    Trailing zeros in the coefficients will be used in the evaluation, so
    they should be avoided if efficiency is a concern.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like, compatible object
        If `x` is a list or tuple, it is converted to an ndarray, otherwise
        it is left unchanged and treated as a scalar. In either case, `x`
        or its elements must support addition and multiplication with
        with themselves and with the elements of `c`.
    c : array_like
        Array of coefficients ordered so that the coefficients for terms of
        degree n are contained in c[n]. If `c` is multidimensional the
        remaining indices enumerate multiple polynomials. In the two
        dimensional case the coefficients may be thought of as stored in
        the columns of `c`.
    tensor : boolean, optional
        If True, the shape of the coefficient array is extended with ones
        on the right, one for each dimension of `x`. Scalars have dimension 0
        for this action. The result is that every column of coefficients in
        `c` is evaluated for every element of `x`. If False, `x` is broadcast
        over the columns of `c` for the evaluation.  This keyword is useful
        when `c` is multidimensional. The default value is True.

    Returns
    -------

def polyvalfromroots(x, r, tensor=True):
    r"""Evaluate a polynomial specified by its roots at points x.

    If `r` is of length `N`, this function returns the value

    .. math:: p(x) = \\prod_{n=1}^{N} (x - r_n)

    The parameter `x` is converted to an array only if it is a tuple or a
    list, otherwise it is treated as a scalar. In either case, either `x`
    or its elements must support multiplication and addition both with
    themselves and with the elements of `r`.

    If `r` is a 1-D array, then `p(x)` will have the same shape as `x`.  If `r`
    is multidimensional, then the shape of the result depends on the value of
    `tensor`. If `tensor` is ``True`` the shape will be r.shape[1:] + x.shape;
    that is, each polynomial is evaluated at every value of `x`. If `tensor` is
    ``False``, the shape will be r.shape[1:]; that is, each polynomial is
    evaluated only for the corresponding broadcast value of `x`. Note that
    scalars have shape (,).

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like, compatible object
        If `x` is a list or tuple, it is converted to an ndarray, otherwise
        it is left unchanged and treated as a scalar. In either case, `x`
        or its elements must support addition and multiplication with
        with themselves and with the elements of `r`.
    r : array_like
        Array of roots. If `r` is multidimensional the first index is the
        root index, while the remaining indices enumerate multiple
        polynomials. For instance, in the two dimensional case the roots
        of each polynomial may be thought of as stored in the columns of `r`.
    tensor : boolean, optional
        If True, the shape of the roots array is extended with ones on the
        right, one for each dimension of `x`. Scalars have dimension 0 for this
        action. The result is that every column of coefficients in `r` is
        evaluated for every element of `x`. If False, `x` is broadcast over the
        columns of `r` for the evaluation.  This keyword is useful when `r` is
        multidimensional. The default value is True.

    deg : int or tuple
        Degree(s) of the fitting polynomials. If `deg` is a single integer

    w : array_like, shape (`M`,), optional
        Weights. If not None, the weight ``w[i]`` applies to the unsquared
        residual ``y[i] - y_hat[i]`` at ``x[i]``. Ideally the weights are
        chosen so that the errors of the products ``w[i]*y[i]`` all have the

    Returns
    -------
    coef : ndarray, shape (`deg` + 1,) or (`deg` + 1, `K`)
        Polynomial coefficients ordered from low to high.  If `y` was 2-D,
        the coefficients in column `k` of `coef` represent the polynomial
        fit to the data in `y`'s `k`-th column.

    [residuals, rank, singular_values, rcond] : list
        These values are only returned if ``full == True``

        - residuals -- sum of squared residuals of the least squares fit
        - rank -- the numerical rank of the scaled Vandermonde matrix
        - singular_values -- singular values of the scaled Vandermonde matrix

    Notes
    -----
    The solution is the coefficients of the polynomial `p` that minimizes
    the sum of the weighted squared errors

    .. math:: E = \\sum_j w_j^2 * |y_j - p(x_j)|^2,

    where the :math:`w_j` are the weights. This problem is solved by
    setting up the (typically) over-determined matrix equation:

    .. math:: V(x) * c = w * y,

    where `V` is the weighted pseudo Vandermonde matrix of `x`, `c` are the
    coefficients to be solved for, `w` are the weights, and `y` are the
    observed values.  This equation is then solved using the singular value
    decomposition of `V`.

    If some of the singular values of `V` are so small that they are
    neglected (and `full` == ``False``), a `RankWarning` will be raised.
    This means that the coefficient values may be poorly determined.
    Fitting to a lower order polynomial will usually get rid of the warning
    (but may not be what you want, of course; if you have independent
    reason(s) for choosing the degree which isn't working, you may have to:
    a) reconsider those reasons, and/or b) reconsider the quality of your
    data).  The `rcond` parameter can also be set to a value smaller than
    its default, but the resulting fit may be spurious and have large
    contributions from roundoff error.

    Polynomial fits using double precision tend to "fail" at about
    (polynomial) degree 20. Fits using Chebyshev or Legendre series are
    generally better conditioned, but much can still depend on the
    distribution of the sample points and the smoothness of the data.  If
    the quality of the fit is inadequate, splines may be a good
    alternative.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c : 1-D array_like
        1-D array of polynomial coefficients.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Array of the roots of the polynomial. If all the roots are real,
        then `out` is also real, otherwise it is complex.

    Notes
    -----
    The root estimates are obtained as the eigenvalues of the companion
    matrix, Roots far from the origin of the complex plane may have large
    errors due to the numerical instability of the power series for such
    values. Roots with multiplicity greater than 1 will also show larger
    errors as the value of the series near such points is relatively
    insensitive to errors in the roots. Isolated roots near the origin can
    be improved by a few iterations of Newton's method.
