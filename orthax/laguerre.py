    in Laguerre form, where the `r_n` are the roots specified in `roots`.
    If a zero has multiplicity n, then it must appear in `roots` n times.
    For instance, if 2 is a root of multiplicity three and 3 is a root of
    multiplicity 2, then `roots` looks something like [2, 2, 2, 3, 3]. The

    represents the series ``L_0 + 2*L_1 + 3*L_2`` while [[1,2],[1,2]]
    represents ``1*L_0(x)*L_0(y) + 1*L_1(x)*L_0(y) + 2*L_0(x)*L_1(y) +
    2*L_1(x)*L_1(y)`` if axis=0 is ``x`` and axis=1 is ``y``.


    Parameters
    ----------
    c : array_like
        Array of Laguerre series coefficients. If `c` is multidimensional
        the different axis correspond to different variables with the
        degree in each axis given by the corresponding index.
    m : int, optional
        Order of integration, must be positive. (Default: 1)
    k : {[], list, scalar}, optional
        Integration constant(s).  The value of the first integral at
        ``lbnd`` is the first value in the list, the value of the second
        integral at ``lbnd`` is the second value, etc.  If ``k == []`` (the
        default), all constants are set to zero.  If ``m == 1``, a single
        scalar can be given instead of a list.
    lbnd : scalar, optional
        The lower bound of the integral. (Default: 0)
    scl : scalar, optional
        Following each integration the result is *multiplied* by `scl`
        before the integration constant is added. (Default: 1)
    axis : int, optional
        Axis over which the integral is taken. (Default: 0).

    Returns
    -------
    S : ndarray
        Laguerre series coefficients of the integral.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``m < 0``, ``len(k) > m``, ``np.ndim(lbnd) != 0``, or
        ``np.ndim(scl) != 0``.

    --------

    Notes
    -----
    Note that the result of each integration is *multiplied* by `scl`.
    Why is this important to note?  Say one is making a linear change of
    variable :math:`u = ax + b` in an integral relative to `x`.  Then
    :math:`dx = du/a`, so one will need to set `scl` equal to
    :math:`1/a` - perhaps not what one would have first thought.

    Also note that, in general, the result of integrating a C-series needs
    to be "reprojected" onto the C-series basis set.  Thus, typically,
    the result of this function is "unintuitive," albeit correct; see
    Examples section below.

    If `c` is of length `n + 1`, this function returns the value:

    .. math:: p(x) = c_0 * L_0(x) + c_1 * L_1(x) + ... + c_n * L_n(x)

    The parameter `x` is converted to an array only if it is a tuple or a
    list, otherwise it is treated as a scalar. In either case, either `x`
    or its elements must support multiplication and addition both with
    themselves and with the elements of `c`.

    If `c` is a 1-D array, then `p(x)` will have the same shape as `x`.  If
    `c` is multidimensional, then the shape of the result depends on the
    value of `tensor`. If `tensor` is true the shape will be c.shape[1:] +
    x.shape. If `tensor` is false the shape will be c.shape[1:]. Note that
    scalars have shape (,).

    Trailing zeros in the coefficients will be used in the evaluation, so
    they should be avoided if efficiency is a concern.

    ----------

    c : array_like
        Array of coefficients ordered so that the coefficients for terms of
        degree n are contained in c[n]. If `c` is multidimensional the
        remaining indices enumerate multiple polynomials. In the two
        dimensional case the coefficients may be thought of as stored in
        the columns of `c`.
    tensor : boolean, optional
        If True, the shape of the coefficient array is extended with ones
        on the right, one for each dimension of `x`. Scalars have dimension 0
        for this action. The result is that every column of coefficients in
        `c` is evaluated for every element of `x`. If False, `x` is broadcast
        over the columns of `c` for the evaluation.  This keyword is useful
        when `c` is multidimensional. The default value is True.

def lagfit(x, y, deg, rcond=None, full=False, w=None):
    r"""Least squares fit of Laguerre series to data.

    Return the coefficients of a Laguerre series of degree `deg` that is the
    least squares fit to the data values `y` given at points `x`. If `y` is
    1-D the returned coefficients will also be 1-D. If `y` is 2-D multiple
    fits are done, one for each column of `y`, and the resulting
    coefficients are stored in the corresponding columns of a 2-D return.
    The fitted polynomial(s) are in the form

    .. math::  p(x) = c_0 + c_1 * L_1(x) + ... + c_n * L_n(x),

    where ``n`` is `deg`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like, shape (M,)
        x-coordinates of the M sample points ``(x[i], y[i])``.
    y : array_like, shape (M,) or (M, K)
        y-coordinates of the sample points. Several data sets of sample
        points sharing the same x-coordinates can be fitted at once by
        passing in a 2D-array that contains one dataset per column.
    deg : int or 1-D array_like
        Degree(s) of the fitting polynomials. If `deg` is a single integer
        all terms up to and including the `deg`'th term are included in the
        fit. A tuple of integers specifying the degrees of the terms to include
        may be used instead.
    rcond : float, optional
        Relative condition number of the fit. Singular values smaller than
        this relative to the largest singular value will be ignored. The
        default value is len(x)*eps, where eps is the relative precision of
        the float type, about 2e-16 in most cases.
    full : bool, optional
        Switch determining nature of return value. When it is False (the
        default) just the coefficients are returned, when True diagnostic
        information from the singular value decomposition is also returned.
    w : array_like, shape (`M`,), optional
        Weights. If not None, the weight ``w[i]`` applies to the unsquared
        residual ``y[i] - y_hat[i]`` at ``x[i]``. Ideally the weights are
        chosen so that the errors of the products ``w[i]*y[i]`` all have the
        same variance.  When using inverse-variance weighting, use
        ``w[i] = 1/sigma(y[i])``.  The default value is None.

    Returns
    -------
    coef : ndarray, shape (M,) or (M, K)
        Laguerre coefficients ordered from low to high. If `y` was 2-D,
        the coefficients for the data in column *k*  of `y` are in column
        *k*.

    [residuals, rank, singular_values, rcond] : list
        These values are only returned if ``full == True``

        - residuals -- sum of squared residuals of the least squares fit
        - rank -- the numerical rank of the scaled Vandermonde matrix
        - singular_values -- singular values of the scaled Vandermonde matrix
        - rcond -- value of `rcond`.

    Notes
    -----
    The solution is the coefficients of the Laguerre series ``p`` that
    minimizes the sum of the weighted squared errors

    .. math:: E = \\sum_j w_j^2 * |y_j - p(x_j)|^2,

    where the :math:`w_j` are the weights. This problem is solved by
    setting up as the (typically) overdetermined matrix equation

    .. math:: V(x) * c = w * y,

    where ``V`` is the weighted pseudo Vandermonde matrix of `x`, ``c`` are the
    coefficients to be solved for, `w` are the weights, and `y` are the
    observed values.  This equation is then solved using the singular value
    decomposition of ``V``.

    If some of the singular values of `V` are so small that they are
    neglected, then a `RankWarning` will be issued. This means that the
    coefficient values may be poorly determined. Using a lower order fit
    will usually get rid of the warning.  The `rcond` parameter can also be
    set to a value smaller than its default, but the resulting fit may be
    spurious and have large contributions from roundoff error.

    Fits using Laguerre series are probably most useful when the data can
    be approximated by ``sqrt(w(x)) * p(x)``, where ``w(x)`` is the Laguerre
    weight. In that case the weight ``sqrt(w(x[i]))`` should be used
    together with data values ``y[i]/sqrt(w(x[i]))``. The weight function is
    available as `lagweight`.

    Notes
    -----
    The root estimates are obtained as the eigenvalues of the companion
    matrix, Roots far from the origin of the complex plane may have large
    errors due to the numerical instability of the series for such
    values. Roots with multiplicity greater than 1 will also show larger
    errors as the value of the series near such points is relatively
    insensitive to errors in the roots. Isolated roots near the origin can
    be improved by a few iterations of Newton's method.

    The Laguerre series basis polynomials aren't powers of `x` so the
    results of this function may seem unintuitive.
